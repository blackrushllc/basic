`BEGIN` is not normally part of classic BASIC.

In this project (BASIL), `BEGIN` introduces a block — a sequence of statements treated as a single statement — and `END` closes that block.

From the grammar and parser (current):
- `block := "BEGIN" { ...statements... } "END"`
- You can use a block wherever the grammar accepts a single `statement`.
- Many constructs also support brace blocks: `{ ... }`.
- Some constructs now support an "implicit" body that continues until a construct-specific terminator (e.g., `END WHILE`, `NEXT`, `END FUNC`).

### Where it’s used and when it’s required
Looking at the parser logic (updated):
- IF…THEN
    - Single-statement form: `IF cond THEN <one statement> [ELSE <one statement>]` — no `BEGIN` required.
    - Block forms supported today:
        - `IF cond THEN BEGIN ... [ELSE ...] END [IF]`
        - `IF cond { ... } [ELSE { ... }]`
    - BEGIN-less multi-line IF (implicit until `END IF`) is not currently allowed.
- WHILE
    - Three forms are accepted:
        1) `WHILE cond BEGIN ... END [WHILE]`
        2) `WHILE cond { ... }`
        3) Implicit body: `WHILE cond` followed by statements until `END [WHILE]`.
- FOR / FOR EACH
    - Three forms are accepted for the loop body:
        1) `BEGIN ... END`
        2) `{ ... }`
        3) Implicit body: statements continue until the matching `NEXT [ident]`.
    - `NEXT [ident]` is required and terminates the loop body.
- Standalone blocks
    - You can write a bare `BEGIN ... END` to create a scoped block (`Stmt::Block`).
- FUNC definitions
    - Three forms are accepted for function bodies:
        1) `BEGIN ... END [FUNC]`
        2) `{ ... }`
        3) Implicit body: statements continue until `END [FUNC]`.

Concrete examples:
- `examples/hello.basil` lines 7–11:
  ```
  IF ans$ == "Y" THEN BEGIN
    PRINT "\nWinken";
    PRINT "\nBlinken";
    PRINT "\nNod;
  END
  ```
- WHILE without `BEGIN`:
  ```
  WHILE i < 10
      PRINT i
      i = i + 1
  END WHILE
  ```
- FOR without `BEGIN` (body runs until `NEXT`):
  ```
  FOR j = 5 TO 1 STEP -1
      PRINT j
      FOR i = 1 TO 5
          PRINTLN i
      NEXT i
  NEXT j
  ```
- `README.md` grammar also documents `block := "BEGIN" { declaration } "END"`.

### Why have `BEGIN`/`END` at all? Benefits
- Unambiguous parsing: The parser instantly knows when a multi-statement block starts and ends without needing indentation rules or numerous matching `END*` keywords.
- Uniform close token: A single `END` closes whatever was opened with `BEGIN`, keeping the keyword set small and nesting simple.
- Flexible statement bodies: Control structures (IF, FOR) can accept either a single statement (compact) or `BEGIN ... END` (multi-statement) with a clear delimiter.
- Simpler implementation: The current lexer/parser are straightforward because they rely on explicit delimiters rather than layout or complex lookahead rules.

### Could we eliminate `BEGIN` from the language?
Technically yes, but you must replace its role with some other delimiting rule. Options and trade-offs:

1) Use construct-specific terminators (classic BASIC style)
- Example: `IF ... THEN ... [ELSE ...] END IF`, `FOR ... NEXT`, `FUNC ... END FUNC`.
- Parser change: After `IF ... THEN`, parse a sequence of statements until `END IF` or `ELSE`; similarly for `FUNC` until `END FUNC`; for loops until `NEXT`.
- Pros: No `BEGIN`; blocks are still explicit. Familiar to many BASIC users.
- Cons: Increases the keyword/phrase set (`END IF`, `END FOR`, `END FUNC`, etc.). The current parser uses a single `END` with `BEGIN` as the opener; you’d need to add and recognize the paired end-phrases.

2) Adopt braces `{ ... }` (C-style)
- Replace `BEGIN`/`END` with `{`/`}`.
- Pros: Concise and familiar to C-like language users.
- Cons: Changes the language’s BASIC flavor; requires lexer support for `{` and `}` and parser changes.

3) Indentation-based blocks (Python-style)
- Use newlines/indentation to form blocks; no explicit `BEGIN`/`END`.
- Pros: Minimal syntax noise.
- Cons: Considerably more complex scanner/parser; whitespace becomes semantically significant; contrary to traditional BASIC.

4) “Implicit until sentinel” without an opener
- After `IF ... THEN`, treat everything up to `ELSE` or an `END`-variant as the block, even without `BEGIN`.
- Pros: Eliminates `BEGIN` in block-y spots.
- Cons: You still need a clear, unambiguous sentinel (e.g., `END IF`). Without specific `END IF`, nested constructs become ambiguous. Using a bare `END` without a prior opener would be very error-prone.

### What would have to change to remove `BEGIN` now?
- Lexer: Remove the `Begin` token and likely add `END IF`, `END FOR`, `END FUNC` (or similar) tokens/phrases, or add `{`/`}`.
- Parser:
    - IF: After `THEN`, parse either one statement or a statement list until `ELSE`/`END IF`. If `ELSE` appears, parse either a single statement or a list until `END IF`.
    - FOR/FOR EACH: Parse body until `NEXT` (as it already does), but you need a way to permit multiple statements; now `BEGIN` provides that. Either make everything up to `NEXT` a block, or introduce `END FOR`.
    - FUNC: Replace the mandatory `BEGIN` with a terminator like `END FUNC`, or infer end-of-function via another header — the explicit terminator is cleaner.
    - Standalone blocks: If you still want arbitrarily scoped blocks, you need an alternative (`{ ... }` or drop the feature).

### Practical recommendation
- We now support implicit bodies where unambiguous and backward compatible:
    - WHILE: implicit until `END [WHILE]`.
    - FOR / FOR EACH: implicit until `NEXT [ident]`.
    - FUNC: implicit until `END [FUNC]` was already supported; documented here for clarity.
- IF: BEGIN-less multi-line form is deferred due to ambiguity with the single-statement form; use `BEGIN ... END` or `{ ... }` for multi-statement IF bodies today.

### Short answers to your question
- What is `BEGIN` used for? To start a multi-statement block that ends with `END`.
- When is it required? Always for function bodies; for control structures when you want more than one statement in the body; and for standalone scoped blocks.
- What benefit does it have? Clear, unambiguous block delimiting with a small keyword set; simpler parsing and clean nesting; BASIC-like feel while allowing both single-line and multi-line bodies.
- Can we eliminate it? Yes, but only by adopting another clear block delimiting strategy (construct-specific end tokens, braces, or indentation). Doing so requires coordinated lexer/parser and grammar changes and will affect most examples/documentation.
